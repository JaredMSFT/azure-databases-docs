# Delete items by partition key value - API for NoSQL (preview)
[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

This article explains how to use the Azure Cosmos DB SDKs to delete all items by logical partition key value. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The *delete items by partition key value* feature is in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Feature overview
 
The delete by partition key feature is an asynchronous, background operation that allows you to delete all documents with the same logical partition key value, by using the Cosmos SDK.

Because the number of documents to be deleted might be large, the operation runs in the background. Though the physical deletion operation runs in the background, the effects are available immediately, as the documents to be deleted don't appear in the results of queries or read operations. 

The delete by partition key operation aims to consume at most 10% of the total available Request Units per second (RU/s) on the container on a *best effort* basis. This helps to limit the resources used by this background task.

## Get started

Update your Azure Cosmos DB account to enable the *delete by partition key* feature using Azure CLI.

1. Set shell variables.

    ```azurecli-interactive
        $resourceGroupName = <azure_resource_group>
        $accountName = <azure_cosmos_db_account_name>
        $DeleteByPk = "DeleteAllItemsByPartitionKey"
    ```

1. List down existing capabilities of your account.

    ```azurecli-interactive
       $cosmosdb = az cosmosdb show \
        --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
        --name $accountName
       $capabilities = ($cosmosdb | ConvertFrom-Json).capabilities 
    ```

1. Add *Delete items by partition key* capability in the list of capabilities if it doesn't exist already. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The list of capabilities must always specify all capabilities that you want to enable, inclusively. This includes capabilities that are already enabled for the account that you want to keep. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
       $capabilities = $DeleteByPk
    ```

1. Update Cosmos DB account to enable *Delete items by partition key* feature.

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az cosmosdb update --capabilities $capabilities \
         -n $accountName -g $resourceGroupName
    ```

#### [.NET](#tab/dotnet-example)

## Sample code

To delete items by partition key, use [version 3.25.0 preview](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) or higher of the Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK.

```csharp
// Suppose our container is partitioned by tenantId, and we want to delete all the data for a particular tenant Contoso

// Get reference to the container
var container = cosmosClient.GetContainer("DatabaseName", "ContainerName");

// Delete by logical partition key
ResponseMessage deleteResponse = await container.DeleteAllItemsByPartitionKeyStreamAsync(new PartitionKey("Contoso"));

 if (deleteResponse.IsSuccessStatusCode) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Delete all documents with partition key operation has successfully started");
}
```

#### [Java](#tab/java-example)

To delete items by partition key, use [version 4.19.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-cosmos) or higher of the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK. The delete by partition key API is marked as beta.

```java
// Suppose our container is partitioned by tenantId, and we want to delete all the data for a particular tenant Contoso

// Delete by logical partition key
CosmosItemResponse<?> deleteResponse = container.deleteAllItemsByPartitionKey(
            new PartitionKey("Contoso"), new CosmosItemRequestOptions()).block();
```

#### [Python](#tab/python-example)

To delete items by partition key, use [beta-version 4.4.0b1](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cosmos/4.4.0b1/) or higher of the Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK. The delete by partition key API is marked as beta.

```python
# Suppose our container is partitioned by tenantId, and we want to delete all the data for a particular tenant Contoso

# Delete by logical partition key
container.delete_all_items_by_partition_key("Contoso")

```

### Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

#### Are the results of the delete by partition key operation reflected immediately?

Yes, once the delete by partition key operation starts, the documents to be deleted don't appear in the results of queries or read operations. This also means that you can write new a new document with the same ID and partition key as a document to be deleted without resulting in a conflict.

See [Known issues](#known-issues) for exceptions. 

#### What happens if I issue a delete by partition key operation, and then immediately write a new document with the same partition key?

When the delete by partition key operation is issued, only the documents that exist in the container with the partition key value are deleted. Any new documents that come in aren't in scope for the deletion. 

### How is the delete by partition key operation prioritized among other operations against the container?

By default, the delete by partition key value operation can consume up to a reserved fraction - 0.1, or 10% - of the overall RU/s on the resource. Any Request Units (RUs) in this bucket that are unused will be available for other nonbackground operations, such as reads, writes, and queries. 

For example, suppose you've provisioned 1000 RU/s on a container. There's an ongoing delete by partition key operation that consumes 100 RUs each second for 5 seconds. During each of these 5 seconds, there are 900 RUs available for nonbackground database operations. Once the delete operation is complete, all 1000 RU/s are now available again. 

### Known issues

In some scenarios, a delete by partition key operation might not immediately guarantee its effects, and partial visibility might occur during the operation. 

- Aggregate queries that use the index - for example, COUNT queries - that are issued during an ongoing delete by partition key operation might contain the results of the documents to be deleted. This could occur until the delete operation is fully complete.
- Queries issued against the [analytical store](../analytical-store-introduction.md) during an ongoing delete by partition key operation might contain the results of the documents to be deleted. This could occur until the delete operation is fully complete.
- [Continuous backup (point-in-time restore)](../continuous-backup-restore-introduction.md) is triggered during an ongoing delete by partition key operation might contain the results of the documents to be deleted in the restored collection. It isn't recommended to use this preview feature if you have a scenario that requires continuous backup.

### Limitations

[Hierarchical partition keys](../hierarchical-partition-keys.md) deletion isn't supported. This feature permits the deletion of items solely based on the last level of partition keys. For example, consider a scenario where a partition key consists of three hierarchical levels: country/region, state, and city. In this context, the delete by partition keys functionality can be employed effectively by specifying the complete partition key, encompassing all levels, namely country/region, state, and city. Attempting to delete using intermediate partition keys, such as country/region or state, or solely country/region, results in an error.
