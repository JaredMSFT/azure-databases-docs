# Build applications for free with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) Free Tier

The free tier lasts for the lifetime of your account, boasting command and feature parity with a regular Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) account.

It makes it easy for you to get started, develop, test your applications, or even run small production workloads for free. With Free Tier, you get a dedicated MongoDB cluster with 32-GB storage, perfect for all of your learning & evaluation needs. Users can provision a single free database server per subscription. This feature is currently available in limited set of regions only.
