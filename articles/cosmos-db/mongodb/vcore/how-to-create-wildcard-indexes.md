# Create wildcard indexes in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB vCore](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb-vcore.md)]

Workloads which have an unpredictable set of fields in the schema can use wildcard indexes to support queries against arbitrary or unknown fields, for optimized performance.

Wildcard indexing can be helpful in the following scenarios:
- Queries filtering on any field in the document making indexing all fields through a single command easier than indexing each field individually.
- Queries filtering on most fields in the document making indexing all but a few fields through a single easier than indexing most fields individually.

## Indexing all fields

Set up a wildcard index to facilitate queries on all possible document fields, including those with unknown or dynamic names.

```javascript
db.collection.createIndex( { "$**": 1 } )
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For large collections, we recommend using alternate approach defined later in this doc.

## Include or exclude specific fields

Wildcard indexes can also be restricted to specific fields while excluding certain fields from being targeted for indexing. Let's review a sample for the following Json.

```json
{
    "firstName": "Steve",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "companyName": "Microsoft",
    "division": "Azure",
    "timeInOrgInYears": 7
}
```

We can control the indexing behavior, the example restricts creating indexes on `firstName`,`lastName` & `timeInOrgInYears` field.

```javascript
db.collection.createIndex( { "$**": 1 },
                           {"wildcardProjection" : {  "firstName": 0
                                                    , "lastName": 0
                                                    , "companyName": 1
                                                    , "division": 1
                                                    , "timeInOrgInYears": 0
                                                   }
                           }
                         )
```

In the wildcardProjection document, the value 0 or 1 indicates whether the field is included (1) or excluded (0) from indexing.

## Alternative for indexing all fields

This sample describes a simple workaround to minimize the effort needed to create individual indexes until wildcard indexing is generally available in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore.

Consider the json document below:
```json
{
    "firstName": "Steve",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "companyName": "Microsoft",
    "division": "Azure",
    "subDivision": "Data & AI",
    "timeInOrgInYears": 7,
    "roles": [
        {
            "teamName" : "Windows",
            "teamSubName" "Operating Systems",
            "timeInTeamInYears": 3
        },
        {
            "teamName" : "Devices",
            "teamSubName" "Surface",
            "timeInTeamInYears": 2
        },
        {
            "teamName" : "Devices",
            "teamSubName" "Surface",
            "timeInTeamInYears": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

The following indices are created under the covers when wildcard indexing is used.
- db.collection.createIndex({"firstName", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"lastName", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"companyName", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"division", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"subDivision", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"timeInOrgInYears", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"subDivision", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"roles.teamName", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"roles.teamSubName", 1})
- db.collection.createIndex({"roles.timeInTeamInYears", 1})

While this sample document only requires a combination of 10 fields to be explicitly indexed, larger documents with hundreds or thousands of fields can get tedious and error prone when indexing fields individually.

The jar file detailed in the rest of this document makes indexing fields in larger documents simpler. The jar takes a sample JSON document as input, parses the document and executes createIndex commands for each field without the need for user intervention.

### Prerequisites

#### Java 21
After the virtual machine is deployed, use SSH to connect to the machine, and install CQLSH using the below commands:

```bash
# Install default-jdk
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

### Sample jar to create individual indexes for all fields

Clone the repository containing the Java sample to iterate through each field in the JSON document's structure and issue createIndex operations for each field in the document.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cosmosdb-mongodb-vcore-wildcard-indexing.git
```

The cloned repository does not need to be built if there are no changes to be made to the solution. The built runnable jar named azure-cosmosdb-mongo-data-indexer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is already included in the runnableJar/ folder. The jar can be executed by specifying the following required parameters:
- Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster connection string with the username and password used when the cluster was provisioned
- The Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore database
- The collection to be indexed
- The location of the json file with the document structure for the collection. This document is parsed by the jar file to extract every field and issue individual createIndex operations.

```bash
java -jar azure-cosmosdb-mongo-data-indexer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@abinav-test-benchmarking.global.mongocluster.cosmos.azure.com/?tls=true&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256&retrywrites=false&maxIdleTimeMS=120000 cosmicworks employee sampleEmployee.json
```

### Track the status of a createIndex operation
The jar file is designed to not wait on a response from each createIndex operation. The indexes are created asynchronously on the server and the progress of the index build operation on the cluster can be tracked.

Consider this sample to track indexing progress on the 'cosmicworks' database.
```javascript
use cosmicworks;
db.currentOp()
```

When a createIndex operation is in progress, the response looks like:
```json
{
  "inprog": [
    {
      "shard": "defaultShard",
      "active": true,
      "type": "op",
      "opid": "30000451493:1719209762286363",
      "op_prefix": 30000451493,
      "currentOpTime": "2024-06-24T06:16:02.000Z",
      "secs_running": 0,
      "command": { "aggregate": "" },
      "op": "command",
      "waitingForLock": false
    },
    {
      "shard": "defaultShard",
      "active": true,
      "type": "op",
      "opid": "30000451876:1719209638351743",
      "op_prefix": 30000451876,
      "currentOpTime": "2024-06-24T06:13:58.000Z",
      "secs_running": 124,
      "command": { "createIndexes": "" },
      "op": "workerCommand",
      "waitingForLock": false,
      "progress": {},
      "msg": ""
    }
  ],
  "ok": 1
}
```
