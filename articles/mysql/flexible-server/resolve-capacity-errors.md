## Register the MySQL resource provider to your subscription

To deploy the Azure Database for MySQL resources, register your subscription with the MySQL resource provider (RP) in the Azure portal.

You can register your subscription using the Azure portal, [the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](/PowerShell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

#### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To register your subscription in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select **More services.**

1. Go to **Subscriptions** and select your subscription.

1. On the **Subscriptions** page, in the left hand pane under **Settings** select **Resource providers.**

1. Enter **MySQL** in the filter to bring up the MySQL-related extensions.

1. Select **Register**, **Re-register**, or **Unregister** for the **Microsoft.DBforMySQL** provider, depending on your desired action.
