# Manage Azure Database for MySQL using the Azure portal

This article shows how to manage your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instances. Management tasks include compute and storage scaling, resetting the server administrator password, and deleting your server.

## Prerequisites

- Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- Go to your Azure Database for MySQL resource in the Azure portal.

## Scale compute and storage

After server creation, you can scale between the various [pricing tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/) as your needs change. You can also increase or decrease vCores to scale up or down your compute and memory.

1. In the Azure portal, select your Azure Database for MySQL. In the Settings section, select Compute + Storage.

1. You can change the **Compute Tier**, **vCore**, and **Storage** to scale up the server using a higher compute tier or scale up within the same tier by increasing storage or vCores to a desired value.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
      > - Storage can't be scaled down.
      > - Scaling vCores causes a server restart.

1. Select **OK** to save changes.

## Reset admin password

You can change the administrator role's password using the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, select your Azure Database for MySQL. In the Overview window, select Reset password.

1. Enter a new password and confirm the password. The textbox prompts you about password complexity requirements.

1. Select **Save** to save the new password.

> [!Important]
> Resetting the server admin password automatically resets the server admin privileges to their default settings. If you accidentally revoke one or more server admin privileges, consider resetting your server admin password to restore them.


## Delete a server

You can delete your server if you no longer need it.

1. In the Azure portal, select your Azure Database for MySQL. In the Overview window, select **Delete**.

1. Type the server's name into the input box to confirm that you want to delete the server.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > Deleting a server is irreversible.

1. Select **Delete**.
