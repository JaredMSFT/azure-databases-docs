# Quickstart: Configure a hybrid cluster with Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra

Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra is a fully managed service for pure open-source Apache Cassandra clusters. The service also allows configurations to be overridden, depending on the specific needs of each workload, for maximum flexibility and control.

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure CLI commands to configure a hybrid cluster. If you have existing datacenters in an on-premises or self-hosted environment, you can use Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra to add other datacenters to those clusters and maintain them.

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.30.0 or later. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- Use an [Azure virtual network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) with connectivity to your self-hosted or on-premises environment. For more information on how to connect on-premises environments to Azure, see [Connect an on-premises network to Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/).

## Configure a hybrid cluster

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to your virtual network resource.

1. Select the **Subnets** tab, and create a new subnet. To learn more about the fields on the **Add subnet** form, see [Add a subnet](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet#add-a-subnet).

    <!--  -->

   The deployment of Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra requires internet access. Deployment fails in environments where internet access is restricted. Make sure that you aren't blocking access within your virtual network to the following vital Azure services that are necessary for Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra to work properly. For a list of IP address and port dependencies, see [Required outbound network rules](network-rules.md).

   - Azure Storage
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
   - Azure Monitor
   - Microsoft Entra ID
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud

1. Apply some special permissions to the virtual network and subnet, which Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra requires, by using the Azure CLI. Use the `az role assignment create` command. Replace `<subscriptionID>`, `<resourceGroupName>`, and `<vnetName>` with the appropriate values:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az role assignment create \
     --assignee a232010e-820c-4083-83bb-3ace5fc29d0b \
     --role 4d97b98b-1d4f-4787-a291-c67834d212e7 \
     --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>
   ```

   The `assignee` and `role` values in the previous command are fixed service principal and role identifiers, respectively.

1. Configure resources for your hybrid cluster. Because you already have a cluster, the cluster name is a logical resource to identify the name of your existing cluster. Use the name of your existing cluster when you define `clusterName` and `clusterNameOverride` variables in the following script.

   You also need, at minimum, the seed nodes from your existing datacenter, and the gossip certificates that are required for node-to-node encryption. Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra requires node-to-node encryption for communication between datacenters. If you don't have node-to-node encryption implemented in your existing cluster, you need to implement it. For more information, see [Node-to-node encryption](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.x/cassandra/configuration/secureSSLNodeToNode.html). Supply the path to the location of the certificates. Each certificate should be in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format, for example, `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...PEM format 1...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. In general, there are two ways to implement certificates:

   - **Self-signed certificates.** Private and public certificates with no Certificate Authority (CA) for each node. In this case, you need all public certificates.
   - **Certificates signed by a CA.** Certificates issued by a self-signed CA or a public CA. In this case, you need the root CA certificate and all intermediaries, if applicable. For more information, see [Prepare Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates for production](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.x/cassandra/configuration/secureSSLCertWithCA.html).

   Optionally, if you want to implement client-to-node certificate authentication or mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS), provide the certificates in the same format as when you created the hybrid cluster. See the Azure CLI sample later in this article. The certificates are provided in the `--client-certificates` parameter.

   This approach uploads and applies your client certificates to the trust store for your Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra cluster. You don't need to edit `cassandra.yaml` settings. After the certificates are applied, the cluster requires Cassandra to verify the certificates when a client connects. For more information, see `require_client_auth: true` in Cassandra [client_encryption_options](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/stable/cassandra/managing/configuration/cass_yaml_file.html).

   The value of the `delegatedManagementSubnetId` variable that you supply in this code is the same as the value of `--scope` that you supplied in an earlier command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='MyResourceGroup'
   clusterName='cassandra-hybrid-cluster-legal-name'
   clusterNameOverride='cassandra-hybrid-cluster-illegal-name'
   location='eastus2'
   delegatedManagementSubnetId='/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/<subnetName>'

   # You can override the cluster name if the original name isn't legal for an Azure resource:
   # overrideClusterName='ClusterNameIllegalForAzureResource'
   # the default cassandra version will be v3.11

   az managed-cassandra cluster create \
     --cluster-name $clusterName \
     --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
     --location $location \
     --delegated-management-subnet-id $delegatedManagementSubnetId \
     --external-seed-nodes 10.52.221.2 10.52.221.3 10.52.221.4 \
     --external-gossip-certificates /usr/csuser/clouddrive/rootCa.pem /usr/csuser/clouddrive/gossipKeyStore.crt_signed
     # optional - add your existing datacenter's client-to-node certificates (if implemented):
     # --client-certificates /usr/csuser/clouddrive/rootCa.pem /usr/csuser/clouddrive/nodeKeyStore.crt_signed
   ```

   If your cluster already has node-to-node and client-to-node encryption, you should know where your existing client or gossip TLS/SSL certificates are kept. If you're uncertain, run `keytool -list -keystore <keystore-path> -rfc -storepass <password>` to print the certificates.

1. After the cluster resource is created, run the following command to get the cluster setup details:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='MyResourceGroup'
   clusterName='cassandra-hybrid-cluster'

   az managed-cassandra cluster show \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
   ```

1. The previous command returns information about the managed instance environment. You need the gossip certificates so that you can install them on the trust store for nodes in your existing datacenter. The following screenshot shows the output of the previous command and the format of certificates.

   :::image type="content" source="media/configure-hybrid-cluster-cli/show-cluster.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the result of getting the certificate details from the cluster." lightbox="media/configure-hybrid-cluster-cli/show-cluster.png":::
    <!--  -->

   The certificates returned from the preceding command contain line breaks that are represented as text. An example is `\r\n`. Copy each certificate to a file and format it before you attempt to import it into your existing trust store.

   Copy the `gossipCertificates` array value shown in the screenshot into a file. Use the following Bash script to format the certificates and create separate PEM files for each. To download the Bash script, see [Download jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for your platform.

   ```bash
   readarray -t cert_array < <(jq -c '.[]' gossipCertificates.txt)
   # iterate through the certs array, format each cert, write to a numbered file.
   num=0
   filename=""
   for item in "${cert_array[@]}"; do
   let num=num+1
   filename="cert$num.pem"
   cert=$(jq '.pem' <<< $item)
   echo -e $cert >> $filename
   sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//' -i $filename
   done
   ```

1. Next, create a new datacenter in the hybrid cluster. Replace the variable values with your cluster details:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='MyResourceGroup'
   clusterName='cassandra-hybrid-cluster'
   dataCenterName='dc1'
   dataCenterLocation='eastus2'
   virtualMachineSKU='Standard_D8s_v4'
   noOfDisksPerNode=4

   az managed-cassandra datacenter create \
     --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
     --cluster-name $clusterName \
     --data-center-name $dataCenterName \
     --data-center-location $dataCenterLocation \
     --delegated-subnet-id $delegatedManagementSubnetId \
     --node-count 9
     --sku $virtualMachineSKU \
     --disk-capacity $noOfDisksPerNode \
     --availability-zone false
   ```

   Choose the value for `--sku` from the following available product tiers:

   - Standard_E8s_v4
   - Standard_E16s_v4
   - Standard_E20s_v4
   - Standard_E32s_v4
   - Standard_DS13_v2
   - Standard_DS14_v2
   - Standard_D8s_v4
   - Standard_D16s_v4
   - Standard_D32s_v4

   The value for `--availability-zone` is set to `false`. To enable availability zones, set this value to `true`. Availability zones increase the availability service-level agreement (SLA) of the service. For more information, see [SLA for online services](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/managed-instance-apache-cassandra/v1_0/).

   Availability zones aren't supported in all regions. Deployments fail if you select a region where availability zones aren't supported. For supported regions, see the [Azure regions list](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

   The successful deployment of availability zones is also subject to the availability of compute resources in all the zones in the specific region. Deployments might fail if the product tier you selected, or capacity, isn't available across all zones.

1. Now that the new datacenter is created, run the `datacenter show` command to view its details:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   resourceGroupName='MyResourceGroup'
   clusterName='cassandra-hybrid-cluster'
   dataCenterName='dc1'

   az managed-cassandra datacenter show \
     --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
     --cluster-name $clusterName \
     --data-center-name $dataCenterName
   ```

   The previous command displays the new datacenter's seed nodes.

   :::image type="content" source="media/configure-hybrid-cluster-cli/show-datacenter.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to get datacenter details." lightbox="media/configure-hybrid-cluster-cli/show-datacenter.png":::

1. Add the new datacenter's seed nodes to your existing datacenter's [seed node configuration](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html#configCassandra_yaml__seed_provider) in the [cassandra.yaml](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html) file. Install the managed instance gossip certificates that you collected earlier to the trust store for each node in your existing cluster. Use the `keytool` command for each certificate:

   ```bash
   keytool -importcert -keystore generic-server-truststore.jks -alias CassandraMI -file cert1.pem -noprompt -keypass myPass -storepass truststorePass
   ```

   If you want to add more datacenters, repeat the preceding steps, but you need only the seed nodes.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If your existing Apache Cassandra cluster has only a single datacenter, and this datacenter is the first one added, ensure that the `endpoint_snitch` parameter in `cassandra.yaml` is set to `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch`.

   If your existing application code uses `QUORUM` for consistency, ensure that *before you change the replication settings in the next step*, your existing application code uses`LOCAL_QUORUM` to connect to your existing cluster. Otherwise, live updates fail after you change replication settings in the following step. After you change the replication strategy, you can revert to `QUORUM` if you prefer.

1. Finally, use the following Cassandra Query Language query to update the replication strategy in each keyspace to include all datacenters across the cluster:

   ```bash
   ALTER KEYSPACE "ks" WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-premise-dc': 3, 'managed-instance-dc': 3};
   ```

   You also need to update several system tables:

   ```bash
   ALTER KEYSPACE "system_auth" WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-premise-dc': 3, 'managed-instance-dc': 3}
   ALTER KEYSPACE "system_distributed" WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-premise-dc': 3, 'managed-instance-dc': 3}
   ALTER KEYSPACE "system_traces" WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'on-premise-dc': 3, 'managed-instance-dc': 3}
   ```

   If the datacenters in your existing cluster don't enforce [client-to-node encryption (SSL)](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/3.11/cassandra/operating/security.html#client-to-node-encryption), and you intend for your application code to connect directly to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra, you also need to enable TLS/SSL in your application code.

## Use a hybrid cluster for real-time migration

The preceding instructions provide guidance on how to configure a hybrid cluster. This approach is also a great way of achieving a seamless zero-downtime migration. The following procedure shows you how to migrate an on-premises or other Cassandra environment that you want to decommission, with zero downtime, to Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra.

1. Configure a hybrid cluster. Follow the previous instructions.
1. Temporarily disable automatic repairs in Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra during the migration:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az managed-cassandra cluster update \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName --repair-enabled false
    ```

1. In the Azure CLI, use the following command to run `nodetool rebuild` on each node in your new Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra datacenter. Replace `<ip address>` with the IP address of the node. Replace `<sourcedc>` with the name of your existing datacenter, the one from which you're migrating:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az managed-cassandra cluster invoke-command \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName \
      --host <ip address> \
      --command-name nodetool --arguments rebuild="" "<sourcedc>"=""
    ```

    Run this command *only after you take all the prior steps*. This approach should ensure that all historical data is replicated to your new datacenters in Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra. You can run `rebuild` on one or more nodes at the same time. Run on one node at a time to reduce the effect on the existing cluster. Run on multiple nodes when the cluster can handle the extra I/O and network pressure. For most installations, you can run only one or two in parallel so that you don't overload the cluster.

   > [!WARNING]
   > You must specify the source `data center` when you run `nodetool rebuild`. If you provide the datacenter incorrectly on the first attempt, token ranges are copied without data being copied for your nonsystem tables. Subsequent attempts fail even if you provide the datacenter correctly. To resolve this issue, delete entries for each nonsystem keyspace in `system.available_ranges` by using the `cqlsh` query tool in your target Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra datacenter:
   >
   > ```shell
   > delete from system.available_ranges where keyspace_name = 'myKeyspace';
   > ```

1. Cut over your application code to point to the seed nodes in your new Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra datacenters.

   As also mentioned in the hybrid setup instructions, if the datacenters in your existing cluster don't enforce [client-to-node encryption (SSL)](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/3.11/cassandra/operating/security.html#client-to-node-encryption), enable this feature in your application code. Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra enforces this requirement.

1. Run `ALTER KEYSPACE` for each keyspace, in the same manner as done earlier. Now you can remove your old datacenters.

1. Run [node tool decommission](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/managing/tools/nodetool/decommission.html) for each old datacenter node.

1. Switch your application code back to `QUORUM`, if necessary or preferred.

1. Reenable automatic repairs:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az managed-cassandra cluster update \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --cluster-name $clusterName --repair-enabled true
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error when you apply permissions to your virtual network by using the Azure CLI, you can apply the same permission manually from the Azure portal. An example of such an error is "Can't find user or service principal in graph database for `e5007d2c-4b13-4a74-9b6a-605d99f03501`." For more information, see [Use the Azure portal to add Azure Cosmos DB service principal](add-service-principal.md).

The Azure Cosmos DB role assignment is used for deployment purposes only. Azure Managed Instanced for Apache Cassandra has no back-end dependencies on Azure Cosmos DB.

## Clean up resources

If you aren't going to continue to use this managed instance cluster, follow these steps to delete it:

1. On the left menu of the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**.
1. From the list, select the resource group that you created for this quickstart.
1. On the resource group **Overview** pane, select **Delete resource group**.
1. On the next pane, enter the name of the resource group to delete, and then select **Delete**.
