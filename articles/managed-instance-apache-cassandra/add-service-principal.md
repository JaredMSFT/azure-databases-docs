# Use the Azure portal to add Azure Cosmos DB service principal

For successful deployment into an existing virtual network, Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra requires the Azure Cosmos DB service principal with a role (such as Network Contributor) that allows the action `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`. In some circumstances, you might be required to add these permissions manually. This article shows you how to use the Azure portal to assign the Azure Cosmos DB service principal.

## Add Azure Cosmos DB service principal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to the target virtual network in your subscription, select **Access control (IAM)**, and then select **Add role assignment**.

1. Search for the **Network Contributor** role, highlight it, and then select the **Members** tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You don't need to have a role with permissions as expansive as Network Contributor. This example is used for simplicity. You can also create a customer role with narrower permissions, as long as it allows the action `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`.

1. Ensure that **User, group, or service principal** is selected for **Assign access to**. Then click **Select members** to search for the **Azure Cosmos DB** service principal. Select it in the pane on the right.

1. Select the **Review + assign** tab, and then select **Review + assign**. The Azure Cosmos DB service principal is now assigned.
